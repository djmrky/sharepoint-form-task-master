# Sharepoint form app


## High-level overview


You are tasked with creating a simple SharePoint application for 
adding and displaying user contacts(list form + chart form).


## Checklist
 
- Create a SharePoint service which will allow us to fetch and add new contacts to our SharePoint

When creating and accessing you SharePoint API
the name of your contacts list is your Firstname and Lastname joined in CamelCase. You should only use ASCII encoding characters (ex. replace `Å›` with `s`). You should have received your contacts list name by e-mail along with test invitation.

Example
```
// contact list name
AnzeMatelic
// Api Example:
_api/Web/Lists/GetByTitle('AnzeMatelic')/Items`
// SharePoint URL example:
https://itcraftship.sharepoint.com/Lists/AnzeMatelic/AllItems.aspx
```


- Create a react form which will submit a new contact to our SharePoint instance with the SharePoint service + Create select input which will fetch the data from the SharePoint API and displayed it on the form (SharePoint list URL `/_api/web/Lists/GetByTitle('Company')/Items`):
  - add validation of required fields before the user can click Save (1 point)
  - add e-mail format validation (1 point)
  - add salary number validation (1 point)
  - add a dropdown with companies fetched from another list at `/_api/web/Lists/GetByTitle('Company')/Items` (1 points)
  - save a contact once user clicks **Save** and the data is valid (1 points)

- Create a react list which will display all added contacts data in the list fetched via SharePoint API (2 points)
- Create a pie chart where you display the salary of the contacts (for example use chartjs library) (3 points)

Creating ssh certificate
```
 gulp trust-dev-cert

Navigate to:
local version -> https://localhost:4321/temp/workbench.html:
